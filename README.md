Learning CPlusPlus
==================

My trying to get comfy with programming in C++

Through this I want to

* Learn to deliver more by coding more often (rather than just thinking about how to theoretically solve a problem)
* Get used to C++ for my first college classes (Data Structures in C++)
* Get more comfy with using git and GitHub
